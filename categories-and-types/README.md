### Categories

*   **Internal reference**: Reference used by the publishing party (e.g. ticket number)
*   **Targeting data**: Targeting information to include recipient email, infected machines, department, and or locations.<br/>
*   **Antivirus detection**: List of anti-virus vendors detecting the malware or information on detection performance (e.g. 13/43 or 67%). Attachment with list of detection or link to VirusTotal could be placed here as well.
*   **Payload delivery**: Information about the way the malware payload is initially delivered, for example information about the email or web-site, vulnerability used, originating IP etc. Malware sample itself should be attached here.
*   **Artifacts dropped**: Any artifact (files, registry keys etc.) dropped by the malware or other modifications to the system
*   **Payload installation**: Location where the payload was placed in the system and the way it was installed. For example, a filename|md5 type attribute can be added here like this: c:\windows\system32\malicious.exe|41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.
*   **Persistence mechanism**: Mechanisms used by the malware to start at boot. This could be a registry key, legitimate driver modification, LNK file in startup
*   **Network activity**: Information about network traffic generated by the malware
*   **Payload type**: Information about the final payload(s). Can contain a function of the payload, e.g. keylogger, RAT, or a name if identified, such as Poison Ivy.
*   **Attribution**: Identification of the group, organisation, or country behind the attack
*   **External analysis**: Any other result from additional analysis of the malware like tools output Examples: pdf-parser output, automated sandbox analysis, reverse engineering report.
*   **Other**: Attributes that are not part of any other category
