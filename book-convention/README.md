# Convention Used in This Book

`code block or value`

* Used for variable, function or menu names in MISP.

## Example Organisations

As MISP is a platform to support information sharing, example organisations are often used within this book.

A set of users and organisations are used in the different examples.

The following two organisations are regularly used as example:

* Setec Astronomy with UUID `58d38339-7b24-4386-b4b4-4c0f950d210f`
* Acme Finance with UUID `58d38326-eda8-443a-9fa8-4e12950d210f`

Starting from MISP 2.4.71, the example organisations with the above mentioned UUID are **black-listed** to avoid  
large distribution of sample events while testing a MISP instance. If you want to test your distribution, the  
sample organisation black-listing can be removed in `Administration` under `Manage Org Blacklists`.
