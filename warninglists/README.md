# MISP warninglists
MISP warninglists are lists of well-known indicators that can be associated to potential false positives, errors or mistakes.

- False-positive is a common issue in threat intelligence sharing.

- Itâ€™s often a contextual issue:
   - false-positive might be different per community of users sharing

   - organization might have their own view on false-positive.

- Based on the success of the MISP taxonomy model, we build misp-warninglists. They are lists of well-known indicators that can be
associated to potential false positives, errors or mistakes. They are Simple JSON files.

The warning lists are integrated in MISP to display an info/warning box at the event and attribute level. This can be enabled at MISP instance level. Default warning lists can be enabled or disabled like known public

pull requests (https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists). Warning lists can be also used for critical or core infrastructure
warning, personally identifiable information...
