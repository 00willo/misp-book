Quick Start

The Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) is the tool which will be used to facilitate the exchange of Indicator of Compromise (IOC) about targeted malware and attacks within your community of trusted members. It is a distributed Indicator of Compromise (IOC) database with technical and non-technical information. Exchanging this information should result in faster detection of targeted attacks and improve the detection ratio, while also reducing the number of false positives.
