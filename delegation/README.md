If you want to publish an event without you or your organisation being tied to it, you can delegate the publication to an other organisation. That also means they will take the ownership of the event.

:warning: You need to have a role with "Delegations access" to delegate an event.

### Send a delegation request

To do so, you first need to put the distribution of the event as "your organisation only".

Otherwise the delagating option will not be available.

When the "Delegate Publishing" option is clicked, a popup will show up:  
![Delegation Popup](./figures/delegationpopup.png)  
Here you can choose 
- to which organisation you wish to delegate the event among all those registered on the server. For this example we are going to ask Setec Astronomy to publish the event for us.
- The distribution option you want to put on the event. You can let the other organisation (called "recipient") choose if you don't mind it. For this example, we will let the recipient decide.

- Finally you can leave a free message to the recipient organisation.

Once the request is sent, a message will appear on the event to remind you of your request.

You can also see more details by clicking on "View request details"

### Answer a delegation request

As the recipient organisation, you will then recieve the request of delegation. You will be notified by a red circl around the envelope on the top right of the screen.  
![Notification](./figures/delegationwaiting.png)  
When you click it, you will be redirected as usual on the dashboard, where we can see one delegation request on the left frame.  
![Dashboard](./figures/dashboard.png)  
Clicking on the "view" link then redirect to an event list view showing all the events other organisations wish to delagate to your organisation. Here we only see one event, from Acme Factory.
![Delegated list](./figures/delagated.png)  
And here are the metadata of the so called event.

If your role have publishing rights, you will be able to manage the delegation request by using one of the two links in the menu.
