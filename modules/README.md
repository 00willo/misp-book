# MISP modules

MISP modules are autonomous modules that can be used for expansion and other services in MISP.
The modules are written in Python 3 following a simple API interface. The objective is to ease the extensions of MISP functionalities without modifying core components. The API is available via a simple REST API which is independent from MISP installation or configuration.
MISP modules support is included in MISP starting from version 2.4.28.
